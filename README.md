# Regression Model
This project creates a machine learning algorithm that is meant use different historical data to be able to predict the change in housing prices for a year, by using a regression model to train and test.

The data used is included in the Excel file, there are three sheets that begin with 'Final' that are the data for the three iterations the model went through. The data in each sheet has information about each state from 2010-2019.

The SlitingData file, contains the code for splitting the data in one of the Excel sheets. It includes two different methods for splitting, one for splitting the whole dataset 70-30. And one for splitting up individual states data for the decade 70-30, based on which one you want to use there are corresponding files to create a regression model using either one.
